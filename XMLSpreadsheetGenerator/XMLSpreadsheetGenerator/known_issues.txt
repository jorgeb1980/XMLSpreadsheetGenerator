Issues related to the software used to test the generator:

(The following applies to Libre Office v4.1.4.2, Open Office v4.0.1) 

Libre Office ignores some border styles, rendering (and then saving them) as either
continuous or double border.

Libre Office ignores ShrinkToFit in alignment.  It will not render it, nor save it.

Libre Office ignores any non-solid fill interior pattern.  It will not render it,
nor save it.

Libre Office ignores individual Protection styles on cells that belong to 
unprotected sheets (OK).  However, when the sheet is protected and the cell has
a style with a specific Protection element, it behaves as unprotected.  The rest of
the document behaves as protected in that case (so, the Protected cell is the
only one that can be modified).  The same thing happens with Open Office.
