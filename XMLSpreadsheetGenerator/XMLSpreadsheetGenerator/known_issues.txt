Issues related to the software used to test the generator:

Libre Office ignores some border styles, rendering (and then saving them) as either
continuous or double border.

Libre Office ignores ShrinkToFit in alignment.  It will not render it, nor save it.

Libre Office ignores any non-solid fill interior pattern.  It will not render it,
nor save it.
