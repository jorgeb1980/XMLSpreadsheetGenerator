Issues related to the rendering of XML spreadsheet documents in the software used to test the generator:

(The following applies to Libre Office v4.1.4.2, Open Office v4.0.1) 

Libre Office apparently ignores some border styles, rendering (and then saving them) as either
continuous or double border.

Libre Office apparently ignores ShrinkToFit in alignment.  It will not render it, nor save it.

Libre Office apparently ignores any non-solid fill interior pattern.  It will not render it,
nor save it.

Libre Office and Open Office apparently ignore and will not render style inheritance as defined in
the official documentation (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/aa140066%28v=office.10%29.aspx#odc_xmlss_ss:style).
However, I have decided to implement it just by programmatically copying every element inside the
parent style to the children.  This would always lead to correct style definitions by
the documentation, just that they would be redundant given a proper implementation of
style inheritance. 

Libre Office apparently ignores individual Protection styles on cells that belong to 
unprotected sheets (OK).  However, when the sheet is protected and the cell has
a style with a specific Protection element, it behaves as unprotected.  The rest of
the document behaves as protected in that case (so, the Protected cell is the
only one that can be modified).  The same thing happens with Open Office.
